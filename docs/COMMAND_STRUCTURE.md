# ✅ **MCP Client - Multiple Command Interface**

You're absolutely right! The package should provide **separate commands** for different use cases instead of forcing everything through `mcp-agent`.

## 🎯 **Fixed Command Structure**

### **Updated `pyproject.toml`**:
```toml
[project.scripts]
mcp = "mcp_client.cli:main"                    # Main interface
mcp-client = "mcp_client.cli:main"             # Same as mcp
mcp-agent = "mcp_client.cli:agent_main"        # Direct to agent
mcp-basic = "mcp_client.cli:basic_client_main" # Direct to basic client
```

## 📋 **Available Commands**

### **1. General MCP Client** (with options)
```bash
mcp                      # General interface with options
mcp-client               # Same as above
mcp --basic              # Use basic MCP client  
mcp --provider=openai    # Use with LLM integration
mcp doctor               # Check setup
mcp models --provider=openai  # List models
```

### **2. Direct MCP Agent** (LLM-enhanced)
```bash
mcp-agent                # Direct to LLM-enhanced agent
# No need for --agent flag, this IS the agent
```

### **3. Direct Basic MCP Client** (protocol only)
```bash
mcp-basic                # Direct to basic MCP protocol client
# Pure MCP protocol, no LLM integration
```

## 🎭 **Use Cases**

### **Just want basic MCP protocol client**:
```bash
mcp-basic
# or
mcp --basic
```

### **Want LLM-enhanced MCP client**:
```bash
mcp-agent  
# or
mcp  # (defaults to LLM-enhanced)
```

### **Want to explore options**:
```bash
mcp doctor              # Check setup
mcp models              # See available models
mcp --help             # See all options
```

## 🏗️ **Architecture Benefits**

### **Clear Separation**:
- **`mcp-basic`**: Pure MCP protocol understanding
- **`mcp-client` / `mcp`**: Flexible interface with options
- **`mcp-agent`**: Direct to LLM-enhanced capabilities

### **Intuitive Usage**:
- Want basic MCP? → `mcp-basic`
- Want agent features? → `mcp-agent` 
- Want to choose? → `mcp` (with options)

### **Professional CLI Design**:
- Multiple entry points for different workflows
- No confusing "agent" naming when you just want MCP client
- Clear separation between protocol and enhanced features

## 📦 **Package Identity Restored**

**Primary Identity**: **MCP Client** 
- `mcp-basic`: Core MCP protocol client
- `mcp-agent`: MCP client with agent capabilities
- `mcp`: General MCP client interface

**Secondary Features**: LLM integration, agent interface, tool orchestration

This structure correctly emphasizes that this is fundamentally an **MCP client package** that demonstrates protocol evolution, not an "AI agent" that happens to use MCP! 🎯

## 🚀 **Installation & Usage**

```bash
# Install
pip install -e .

# Use basic MCP client (no LLM)
mcp-basic

# Use MCP client with agent capabilities  
mcp-agent

# Use general interface (with options)
mcp --provider=openai
mcp --basic
mcp doctor
```

**Perfect separation of concerns while maintaining the evolution story! ✅**
